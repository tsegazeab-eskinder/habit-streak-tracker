# Habit and Streak Tracker
Our program tackles a common challenge many people face — building and maintaining good habits. By using a streak-based system, it motivates users to stay consistent with their daily routines. Every day you complete a habit, your streak grows. Miss a day, and your streak resets — encouraging commitment and helping users become better versions of themselves over time.
The app runs entirely through a Python terminal interface and is built using the latest version of Python. It's simple, fast, and focused on forming discipline through habit tracking.
