# Habit and Streak Tracker
Our program tackles a common challenge many people face — building and maintaining good habits. By using a streak-based system, it motivates users to stay consistent with their daily routines. Every day you complete a habit, your streak grows. Miss a day, and your streak resets — encouraging commitment and helping users become better versions of themselves over time.
The app runs entirely through a Python terminal interface and is built using the latest version of Python. It's simple, fast, and focused on forming discipline through habit tracking.
 ## Main Features
 ### Add new habits
 This feature lets users create a new habit they want to track.
 For example: “Read for 30 minutes” or “Exercise”.
 The user types in the habit name, and it gets saved in the system along with:
 - The date it was created
 - A streak count starting at 0
 - A log to track if it’s completed each day

 ### Mark habits as completed
 This is used daily to say: “Yes, I did this habit today.”
 When the user selects a habit and marks it as done:
 - It checks the date
 - If it’s a new day and the previous day was done → streak goes up by 1
 - If the previous day was missed → streak resets to 1
 This helps users stay consistent by rewarding them with a growing streak.

 ### Track daily streaks
 This shows how long the user has been consistently doing each habit.
 Seeing streaks grow motivates users to not break the chain.

 ### View habit history
 This shows a log of which days each habit was completed.
 It helps answer questions like:
 - “Did I miss any days this week?”
 - “How consistent have I been with this habit?”

 ### Edit or remove habits
 Sometimes users want to:
 - Rename a habit
 - Fix a mistake
 - Delete a habit they no longer care about

This feature gives that flexibility:
 - You can change a habit’s name
 - Or completely delete it and its data
